# Advertising_Dataset-Implementation_of_Machine_Learning_Alogithims

Analyze Advertising Data with Linear Regression, KNN, K-Means, Decision Tree, Random Forest Algorithims

## Tasks
* Import necessary Libraries
* Upload dataset
* For Linear Regressio :
  ** Check Assumptions for Linear Regression
* Perform Explorartory Data Analysis (EDA) : USe heatmap and plots to understand relationship among features
  **Handel Missing values
  ** Outliers
  ** Data Normality
  Perform Feature scaling
* Train_test_split the model
* Model Fitting :
  ** For Linear Regression Model and genrate Metrics and model predection for Train Data and Test data
* Find Intercept, Coefficients of features
* Check for Assumption :
  ** Mean of Resudals
  ** Homoscedasticity
  ** Check Normality
  ** No autocorrelation of residuals
  ** No multicollinearity
* Re-run of the Model for Feature selected and generate Metrics
* Visualize predeted and train data and resulas
* Save the Model(Pickle)
* Perform model fitting for KNN, K-Means, Decision Tree, Random Forest Algorithims
* Conclude which modle is best
